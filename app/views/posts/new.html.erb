<%= render 'form', post: Post.new %>



#@post the form_for will check @post for an id.
#When you pass a @post from the controller in the new action as @post = Post.new the id will be set to ? nil,
#so form_for checks the id and knows its nil therefore its make its a post action instead of an update.
#
#When you pass a @post from the controller in the edit action as @post = post.find_buy(id: params(:id)) the id will be not nil.
#So form_for will know and therefore make it an update action.
